a. What is an issue?
An issue in GitHub is a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other issues related to a project. It is a way to communicate about specific topics or tasks within a repository.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows collaborators to review, discuss, and merge changes from one branch into another, usually from a feature branch into the main branch.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
- Create a new branch from the main branch.
- Make your changes in the new branch.
- Push the branch to GitHub.
- Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
- Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
- Click "New Pull Request."
- Select the branch you want to merge into the main branch and submit the pull request.

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
- Go to the repository on GitHub.
- Click on "Settings."
- Click "Collaborators & Teams."
- Click "Add collaborator."
- Enter the collaboratorâ€™s username and select them from the list.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git and provides additional features for collaboration, such as hosting repositories, issues, pull requests, and more.

f. What does git diff do?
`git diff` shows the differences between files in the working directory and the index or between two commits. It highlights what changes have been made before they are staged or committed.

g. What is the main branch?
The `main` branch is the default branch in most Git repositories. It usually contains the stable, production-ready code.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
It is generally recommended to create a new branch for your changes, make your edits, and then create a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch. This allows for review and helps maintain a stable `main` branch.
